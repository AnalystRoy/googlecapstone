## Introduction
Cyclistic is a bike-share company in Chicago. In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share program that has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime. There are three types of plan
### Membership plans: Single-ride passes, Full-day passes, and Annual memberships 
Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members. <b>Cyclistic’s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders </b>. Therefore the director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships
## Project Objective
1) Understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently
2) Use these insights, to design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members.
3) Analyze the Cyclistic historical bike trip data to identify trends
